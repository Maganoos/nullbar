NullBar is a simple utility mod that disables Minecraftâ€™s locator bar by default. Unlike other mods with similar functionality, NullBar includes a keybind that lets you temporarily show the bar again while the key is held.

It is super lightweight and requires minimal dependencies - only the Fabric API for keybinding functionality.
